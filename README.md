# Dilsen-OS
A spin on Operating Systems. This is a simulation!
# This is my largest project yet!
# Secrets
- I have hiden a couple of secrets throughout the entire OS try to find them but pressing random buttons or looking through the files.
# More to come!
- Due to the limited time I have, I was not able to add a couple of things I wanted to add. So in the next update I will add many more things.
# Handmade
- All the icons and backgrounds except for the checker one have been handmade by me and @Torus!
# Checklist
- This is just a simple list of the things I want to add next update:
- A TaskBar
- More customization through settings.
- Improvements to the beholder and possible rework of the app.
- Ability to upload songs to the music app and a miniplayer window mode.
- A starting screen.
- Addition of simple games which can be played through beholder app.
